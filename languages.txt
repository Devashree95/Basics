What is your favourite programming language? Why?

My favorite programming language is Python. Being a Data Engineer myself, python is very useful for building efficient data pipelines. 
I love Python for fllowing reasons:
1. Python has a relatively low learning curve which makes it easier to learn.
2. We can implement many tasks by writing only a few lines of code.
3. The code is more readable.
4. Provides a wide variety of very useful libraries and in built functions like NumPy, Pandas etc. that can be used very easily with many applications.
5. Python is open source
6. All the cloud providers provide SDK for Python


Is your favorite language the one you are also most experienced with? If not, which language are you most experienced with?

I am most experienced withPython which is also my favorite language. I have been working as a Data Engineer since last 6 years. 
Python is very useful for Data Engineering applications. I have worked on Pyspark, which is used to implement Big Data solutions 
using Python. Using varous libraries available in Python, I have implemented data processing pipelines which includes importing 
data into the system from multiple sources, cleaning the data, implementing data checks and quality checks, build transformation 
logics and making data available for the front end layers to be utilized.
Apart from Python, I have some experience in Hive and Sql.
